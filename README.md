# Projet_ADA

The idea of the proposed project is to corroborate certain macroeconomic principles such as the relationship between the idea of relative wealth and spending behaviour.

To do so, we try to study the evolution of inflation versus household consumption and house price index and household consumption. The aim would then be to calculate the latency in the changes in the dependent trend (household consumption) in response to those in the inflation rate / house price index.

This would effectively help us understand the normal population's actual behaviour in relation to what macro-economic principles predict.

We then propose to check this for countries and see if there is a correlation between the average education level for a given country and consumer behaviour.

We propose to do this for Switzerland, Italy, Germany, India and Kenya( or any other countries whose data is relatively complete for the chosen time period with the world bank c.f. http://databank.worldbank.org/data/home.aspx)


Disclaimer: The above proposal is bound to change during the course of the project based on the data and findings.
